This program generates a pair of line graphs showing how a Broadband MLP's
costs spread over a range of subscribers in total and subscribers per mile.
It will illustrate how much profit or loss the MLP will incure for a given
total monthly subscriber price for a given number of subscribers.

The cost basis is computed based on the idea that there are three "buckets"
of costs (expenses): the per network (fixed) costs, the per subscriber costs,
and per mile costs.  The basis is computed from these numbers (presently 
hardwired and taken from the MBI Sustainability Worksheet):

Complete Documentation is in the source file (MLPCostGraphs.tcl) and a paper
based on this data is in the    MLPCostsWithRegionalization subdirectory in a
file named MLPCostsWithRegionalization.tex (LaTeX source, a plain text file).
